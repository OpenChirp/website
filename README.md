# OpenChirp Website

This website is built using Angular and Angular Material. It includes the splash page of OpenChirp, as well as the dashboard page.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

Run `npm i -g angular-cli-ghpages` to install `angular-cli-ghpages`, then run `ng build --prod --base-href "https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY/"`, followed by `sudo ngh`. This will build the Angular app, and deploy to the gh-pages branch.
